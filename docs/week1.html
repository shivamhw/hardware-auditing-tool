        to perform voltage glitching, essentially allowing pi to turn off or on the target device to make target device boot into a unsafe state.
        <h3>Steps : </h3>

<ol>
  <li>Making circuit based on lm317( Variable power supply) </li>
  <li>Making the controlling interface on pi</li>
  <li>Exposing that control on a webpage hosted by pi</li>
