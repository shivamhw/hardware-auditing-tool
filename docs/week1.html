	<h2>
        Objective (5/12/21)
        </h2>
        create a web server hosted on Pi that can control a power supply.
        <h3>Justification</h3>
        to perform voltage glitching, essentially allowing pi to turn off or on the target device to make target device boot into a unsafe state.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E0PWQvW-14">Hacking apple airtag with voltage glitching</a>
        <h3>Steps : </h3>

<ol>
  <li>Making circuit based on lm317( Variable power supply) [Done] </li>
  <li>Making the controlling interface on pi          [Done]</li>             
  <li>Exposing that control on a webpage hosted by pi [Done]</li>
</ol>  
<h2>Update on step 1</h2>
in this, we demonstrated a Variable power supply which can be controlled via Pi to preform undervolting and over volting. The potentiometer which is getting changed manually,
will be replaced by a voltage controlled resistor. (will change once i aquire the correct part)

<h2>Update on step 2 and 3</h2>
in this, the led blinks in pattern. by controlling power supply, we could turn off and on the LED such that you would only see only one color.
this demonstrate the ability to preciously by a web server hosted on PI. Which will be used in breaking the boot process.
